RAPFT
=====

RAPFT is an acronym of "Really Annoying Program For Teachers". 
I'm doing this just for fun! (PS. Actually it's nothing there, just go away)

What this going to do
 - Play Sounds from internal PC beeper, It's going to gain data from external files with info about sound
 - It's going to be fully hidden from system (maybe even from Task Manager)
 - Have to play randed theme each somekinda interval
 - Autostart, Typical :P

 - ... Many other features that I still don't know
 
 I will update this file as soon as possible, because actually it's really unreadable :D
